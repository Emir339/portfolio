        <p class="text-dark">My name is Emir Taalaibekov and I am 20 years old. I am studying at
            the Ala-Too University in the direction
            of "Informatics and Computer Engineering". I like to work with different programs and study their work
            structure. Since childhood, I have been interested in how technology works, how websites and applications
            work. I want to learn how to create applications that will be convenient for myself and for others.</p>

                During my school years, I played volleyball and participated in competitive games. Volleyball taught me
                many
                things, introduced me to various talented and interesting people.

                    <img src="../Portfolio/Images/pixel project.jpeg" alt="Pixel-game" class="Pixel-game">
                    <p class="text-dark">In the first year we were given the task - to create a project. We divided into
                        groups and
                        created a pixel game. We explained how the code works and solved problems and ways to improve
                        the code. Our project was made with tkinter. We have created spaceships for two players. The
                        project
                        was simple and uncomplicated. Later, we learned how to create a telegram bot and tried to add
                        functions to work with it.
